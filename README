/* $Id */

-- SUMMARY --

Works for D6.

Adds contextual links for several objects like nodes, views, blocks etc.
It's also an API which other modules can hook into to add or alter
extra links.

You need to add an extra variable to your template files:

- node: $node_classes
- views: $views_classes
- block: $block_classes
- page: $page_classes

There is still some stuff todo - cleaning up API, settings page
and other stuff which we've probably forgotten.
